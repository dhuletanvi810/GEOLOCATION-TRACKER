*DESCRIPTION*: 
 As part of my Python learning journey, I developed a simple yet practical project called an IP-Based Geolocation Tracker. The main objective of this project was to understand how to fetch a user's location using their IP address and then visualize it on an interactive map. I used a Mumbai-based IP address (103.21.75.122) for demonstration purposes. The project displays basic location details like the IP address, city, state, country, and exact geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). It then generates a map using the Folium library and places a marker on the corresponding location. The map is saved as an HTML file and automatically opened in the user's browser for easy viewing.

This project helped me explore how to use external data (like geolocation), visualize it meaningfully, and build user-friendly outputs — all using Python. I also learned the importance of data privacy, especially when working with location-based services. As a next step, I would like to enhance this project by adding real-time tracking, multiple location support, or even a graphical interface using tools like Tkinter or Streamlit. Overall, this was a great hands-on project to strengthen my understanding of APIs, data handling, and interactive map generation in Python.

While building this project, I also became more comfortable working with HTML outputs, integrating third-party libraries, and using tools like webbrowser to create dynamic user experiences. The experience taught me how simple Python scripts can be combined with web technologies to make powerful and interactive tools. Even without any web development framework, this project shows how Python alone can be used to create a browser-based output.
In the future, I plan to integrate this concept into a web dashboard or a mobile app using frameworks like Flask or Kivy. This would allow users to enter any IP address and view its location instantly on a map, making it a useful tool for learning or network diagnostics. I’m excited about the possibilities and how I can evolve this small idea into something more feature-rich and educational.
